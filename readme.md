# Feliz

This is my datingapp for project Tech. This is a project for my study communication and multimedia design. This is a 10 week project.
[Project tech repository](https://github.com/cmda-bt/pt-course-18-19)

Description
>In Project Tech students build a dynamic prototype of a web application. In different roles you take a well-argued position on, among other things, the privacy and security aspects of the application. You'll also learn to navigate the command line, version control with Git & GitHub and make sure code style is consistent.
